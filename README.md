# AI-Growth-Copilot-V1

AI Growth Copilot is an idea I came up with in order to help people reach goals and track their progression on them.


The idea is that you chat with an AI bot that will further deepen its understanding of your goal, once it fixates on what your asking it will display a few options related to your discussion. The user can pick out of the options given, or if what they were asking is not listed, they can choose to keep chatting with the AI bot inorder to get a more accurate result. Once the user finally chooses their desired skill or goal, the AI bot will build out a roadmap for how to reach this goal or accuire the skill. The goal will be stored in the users personal profile, and when clicked it will display the roadmap with a total percentage progression bar. Ofcourse people will have multiple skills and goals, they can create new ones or delete according to their liking. Users can increase the total progression on each roadmap by checking off and completing subskills. Users will be able to add edit the progression tree by inserting or deleting to their liking. Once a goal is complete it gets saved as a completed goal or acquired skill. Users will be able to look at all of their completions as a self rewarding boost of confidence and will theoretically push people to. do great things. 


There are some very important things to note:
If the goal is short term, like i want to make a pancake the bot should recognize it is 
if the goal is 


The issue it solves is that people often time want something, but they dont know how to get there. It also solves the problem of tracking progression. Often times people will not realize how close they are to something and get discourraged. 


This is a chat bot,

and copilot

# AI Growth Copilot (TreeMap Demo)

This project includes a simple `TreeMap` (binary search tree) in Python.

## Usage

```python
from treebuilder import TreeMap

t = TreeMap()
t.insert(5, "root")
t.insert(3, "left")
t.insert(7, "right")

print(t.contains(5))        # True
print(t.minKey())           # 3
print(t.maxKey())           # 7
print(t.getInorderKeys())   # [3, 5, 7]
